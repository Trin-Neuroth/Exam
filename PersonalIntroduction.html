        <p> My favorite culture that I am not a part of would have to be 
        the Chinese culture! I like the festivities they do, their martial arts and the food they eat.
        <p> One historical figure who I look up to would be Harriet Tubman 
        because she helped advocate for women's right to vote and end slavery. The
        second historical figure would have to be Marie Curie because she discovered
        Radioactivity and was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
        <p> A meal that represents me would be spaghetti, or chili!
        <p> I feel most creative when I am reading or journaling!
